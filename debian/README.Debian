Django-Mailman3 Debian Package
==============================

Footer links
------------

Version 1.3.0-2 of the package introduces a new mechanism to add additional
links in the footer by the system administrator. It allows you to add links
required by law such as a privacy policy or contact information without editing
the templates itself. Just add the following Python code snippet to
/etc/mailman3/mailman3-web.py:

FOOTER_LINKS = [
    {
        'url': '/privacy.html',
        'text': 'Privacy Policy',
        'translations': {
            'de': 'Datenschutzerkl√§rung'
        }
    },
]

The link title can be localized.


Disable Gravatar
----------------

Version 1.3.0-2 of the package allows system administrators to disable
Gravatar. This avoids requests to secure.gravatar.com which is seen as a
unnecessary leak of personal data. The leak is closed by just displaying a
generic avatar image for all accounts. The patch does not introduce an
independent avatar management by Hyperkitty/Postorius.
