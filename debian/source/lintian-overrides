# Although upstream released django_mailman3 1.2.0a1, which supports python3,
# it is not yet packaged into debian. Yet, there is a python3 branch on
# https://salsa.debian.org/mailman-team/django-mailman3.git .
#
# The python3 version will be provided as soon as hyperkitty and postorius
# version 1.2.0 has been released, as this common 1.2.0 version will be the one
# supporting fully python3, and dropping python2
